A personal note keeping app. (+ Markdown Support) 📝

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `firebase emulator:start`

The app also requires a firebase backed.
Use this command to launch the emulator for firebase.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
